Chrome extension to modify a websiteâ€™s HTML or CSS

This is useful because:

* No access is required to the websites source files
* The extension shares assets with the page, so matching styling is easy
* It allows one to visualise a demo or feature as if it were in production
* more custom features and autofill added
